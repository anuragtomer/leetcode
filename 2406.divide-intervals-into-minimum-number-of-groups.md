*Divide Intervals into Minimum Number of Groups*

- The aim is to divide the intervals into groups such that they don't overlap and
the number of groups are minimum.
- This can be solved by greedy algorithm. Sort the intervals with start time.
  Find the first interval group that can fit in the next incoming interval.
  After greedily fitting intervals, the number of overlapping intervals is the
  number of groups.
- This is exactly like meeting rooms.

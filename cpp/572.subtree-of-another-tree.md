#Subtree of Another Tree

_Problem Statement_:
Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.
A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

_Solution Idea_:
A simple one.
Do any tree traversal. If the root value matches subRoot value, then check if tree rooted at root is same as subRoot tree. Otherwise move to children and check again.

_Space Complexity_: O(1) - Not saving anything.
_Time Complexity_: O(N*M) - If n is the number of nodes in root and m is the number of nodes in subRoot, since each of the node can trigger a try to match.

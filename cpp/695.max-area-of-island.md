# 695. Max Area of Island

_Problem Statement_:
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

_Solution Idea_:
- Do either dfs or bfs.
- As soon as you find '1', traverse its neighbors using either dfs or bfs and keep a count of how many you traversed.
- Change the visited '1's to '0' so that you don't visit them again.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n.m)** - We would be visiting each point at max twice.

_Space Complexity_: **O(n.m)** - In worst case, when whole grid is single island, we would need to keep things in queue to traverse.

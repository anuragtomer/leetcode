#Min Stack

_Problem Statement_:

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

- MinStack() initializes the stack object.
- void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
- void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
- int top() gets the top element of the stack.
- int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

_Solution Idea_:

Since we want to return min element from the current set of elements in O(1)
time, lets maintain another stack (called min_stack) that keeps track of minimum
element for the current normal stack, i.e., whenever
- a new element is inserted, check if this is smaller than **OR EQUAL TO** the current minimum element. If so, push it to min stack.
- Any element is poped, check if it was equal to min stack's top element, i.e., was this element minimum element? If so, pop from min stack too.

Time Complexity: **O(n)** - Each element is pushed or poped only once and there are no extra traversals to find out minimum element in O(1).

Space Complexity: **O(n)** - Basically O(2n). We maintain 2 stacks. In worst case(all elements in decreasing order, or are equal), we would have same values in both stacks.

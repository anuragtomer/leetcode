# Word Break

_Problem Statement_:
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

_Solution Idea_:
- Dynamic Programming Problem
- Maintain a boolean vector corresponding to given string s, denoting till what point, have we matched from beginning.
- Starting from each character, compare whether a substring can be formed that matches something in wordDict. If it matches, and we have matched till ith index, then set i + wordDict[k].size()'th index to true, i.e., we can now form till i + wordDict[k].size() using words from wordDict.
- If we can reach the end of s like that, then return true, else return false.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n.wordDict size)** - We only traverse given string once. But we do create multiple substrings repeatedly. Idea can be modified to (n^2).

_Space Complexity_: **O(n)** - Saving a bool vector of given string s's size.

# Linked List Cycle II

_Problem Statement_:

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

_Solution Idea_:
- Slow pointer, fast pointer.
- Let them crash into each other. If fast pointer reaches end of list, then definitely no cycle. If they crash into each other, reset fast pointer to beginning and let it move slowly. Next time they crash, that's the start of cycle.
- Floyd Cycle detection algorithm

_Time Complexity_: O(n)

_Space Complexity_: O(1)

# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

_Problem Statement_:
Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

_Solution Idea_:
- Divide the array in 2 halves.
- Make root with mid element.
- Create left child with left half of the array and right child with right half of the array.

_Time Complexity_: O(n)

_Space Complexity_: O(n)

# Remove Invalid Parentheses

_Problem Statement_:
Given a string s that contains parentheses and letters, remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make the input string valid.

Return a list of unique strings that are valid with the minimum number of removals. You may return the answer in any order.

_Solution Idea_:
- Find out how many open braces and close braces are unmatched.
- Traverse the string and
        - If its open bracket
                - It may either start valid string from here on. So append this to current string, increment unmatched_open and see what happens for next character.
                - It may be an extra open bracket. Ignore it and try for next character.
        - If its close bracket
                - See if there is any unmatched_open. If there is add this to current string and see what happens for next character.
                - It may be an extra close bracket. Ignore it if there are some left over extra close brackets and try for next character.

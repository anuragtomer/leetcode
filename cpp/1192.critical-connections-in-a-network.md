# 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

_Problem Statement_:

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

_Solution Idea_:

- Tarjan's Algorithm to find strongly connected components: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan's_strongly_connected_components_algorithm
- Read above. It explains better.

_Time Complexity_: **O(V + E)**

_Space Complexity_: **O(V)** - To save the ranks.

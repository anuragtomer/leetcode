# Design Add and Search Words Data Structure


_Problem Statement_:
Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the WordDictionary class:
- `WordDictionary()`: Initializes the object.
- `void addWord(word)`: Adds word to the data structure, it can be matched later.
- `bool search(word)`: Returns true if there is any string in the data structure that matches word or false otherwise. word may contain dots '.' where dots can be matched with any letter.

_Solution Idea_:
- Create a trie-node to keep track of which child paths are inserted.
- Keep a marker to denote whether some word ended at that node.
- Insertion is simple. Keep creating child if there is none as you add words.
- Search for . basically is to check if any of the child lead to solution.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n)** - Add words is O(n). Search is O(n) when there are no wild characters. O(26^n) if search input is just wild character(.). n being the length of input string.
_Space Complexity_: **O(W.n)** - W being the number of words, n length of each word.

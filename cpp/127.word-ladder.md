# Word Ladder

_Problem Statement_:
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
- sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

_Solution Idea_:
- BFS
- Push the starting word in bfs queue.
- Do following in loop:
        - Pull up next word from queue.
        - Try changing each character to all 26 characters and see if its in wordList.
        - If it is, put it in queue and delete it word wordList so that its not picked back again.
        - If you've put all neighbors of current set of strings, increase sequence length.
        - If you've found endWord, return current sequence length.
- If queue is empty, return 0

_Time Complexity_: **O(26 . length of each word . n)** - We would traverse each word character by character and try out all 26 replacements.
_Space Complexity_: **O(n)** - Space needed to save all elements from wordList in queue.

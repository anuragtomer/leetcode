# Generate Parenthesis

_Problem Statement_
Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

_Solution Idea_:
- Backtracking solution.
- Keep track of how many open parenthesis and close parenthesis have been added.
- If open parens are less than n, add one to current string and loop again.
- If close paren are less than open ones, add one to current string and loop again.

_Time Complexity_: O(2^n) - Since we are generating all possible valid combinations. Or (C(n)) - Catalan number = 4^n/n^(3/2).
_Space Complexity_: O(n) - Stack length to run recursion. O(n) to save current valid string. O(2^n) - To save all valid strings.

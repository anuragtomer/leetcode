# Insert Interval

_Problem Statement_:

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

_Solution Idea_:

- Push all the intervals which come before incoming newInterval.
- If I haven't pushed anything to result set, or newInterval starts after last interval in result, push this new interval at the end.
- Else, adjust ending of last interval in result set to be max of what it already is vs what this newInterval is bringing in.
- Continue pushing the rest of the intervals for input set. Merge as in step 2 and 3.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n)** - We only traverse input set once.

_Space Complexity_: **O(n)** - Need to copy the input in another result set.

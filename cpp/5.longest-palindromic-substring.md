# Longest Palindromic Substring

_Problem Statement_:
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

_Solution_:
- From each index, try to expand left and right as long as you can make a palindrome.
- Do for both even and odd length (expand from i, i and then i, i+1).
- Keep track of longest palindrom seen till now and return the same at the end.

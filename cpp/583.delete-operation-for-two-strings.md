# Delete Operation for Two Strings

_Problem Statement_:

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.
In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

_Solution Idea_:
- Dynamic Programming Problem
- Compare each character of word1 with each character of word2.
- If both are same, take what was the count before these 2 characters(diagonal count).
- If both are not same, take minimum of 1 up and 1 left.

_Time Complexity_: O(n.m) - Need to traverse all characters

_Space Complexity_: O(n.m), but can be reduced to O(n) if we only keep 2 vectors to keep track of current count and 1 for previous count.

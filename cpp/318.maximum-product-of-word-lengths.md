# Maximum Product of Word Lengths

_Problem Statement_:
Given a string array words, return the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

_Solution Idea_:
- Create a number by or'ing the characters in each word.
- Maintain a map from this number to the longest length seen for this number.
- Traverse this map twice to find the longest product of lengths.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n.word length + n^2)** - We traverse each word character by character only once. Then we are traversing the map in nested way.

_Space Complexity_: **O(n)** - We maintain a map for each input word.

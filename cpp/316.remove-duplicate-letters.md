# Remove Duplicate Letters

_Problem Statement_:
Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is 
the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
 
_Solution Idea_:
- Idea is, for each character decide if this can be kept in the possible solution or, if we would be able to find another place later on in our journey.
- To do so, first count occurrences of each character. This would help deciding if there is another occurrence down the lane or not.
- Maintain a hash to keep track of what characters are already part of solution. This would help in avoiding duplicacy.
- Now, with both datastructures decided, traverse the input string.
- For any new incoming character, remove characters from current solution from back if
        - last character is greater than current incoming character (Since we want lexographically shortest)
        - we haven't pushed this incoming character into result yet.
        - there would be more chances to put the last character down the lane.
- Push this incoming character to result if it hasn't been inserted yet.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n)** - Since we would be traversing each character at most twice. Once when push into result, but later we need to remove to maintain lexographical ordering.
_Space Complexity_: **O(n)** - We would be saving each unique character in hash and a counter vector.

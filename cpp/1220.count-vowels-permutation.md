#Count Vowels Permutation

_Problem Statement_:
Given an integer n, your task is to count how many strings of length n can be formed under the following rules:
- Each character is a lower case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
- Each vowel 'a' may only be followed by an 'e'.
- Each vowel 'e' may only be followed by an 'a' or an 'i'.
- Each vowel 'i' may not be followed by another 'i'.
- Each vowel 'o' may only be followed by an 'i' or a 'u'.
- Each vowel 'u' may only be followed by an 'a'.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

_Solution Idea_:
Simple one if you think about it.
Each vowel can trigger only certain other vowels. Keep adding them up for input n times.
For e.g.: a can be appended to string because of e, i, u. So add their counts from n-1 th run.
e can be appended to string because of a, i. So add their counts from n-1th run.
And so on.
Return the sum of all one you've exhausted n.

_Time Complexity_:**O(n)** - We need not traverse any row more that once.
_Space Complexity: **O(1)** - We just need 5 variable to store current count, and 5 to keep track of last run.

# Largest Number

_Problem Statement_:
Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.
Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

_Solution Idea_:
- Kind of sorting numbers and then appending.
- Caveat is when there are more than 1 string which have same prefix, then sorting has to be modified.
- For e.g., if the 2 numbers are 45 and 41, we should have 45 first since 4145 would be smaller than 4541.
- So, sort based on whichever string is greater when appended.

_Time Complexity_: O(NlogN) - Sorting complexity.

_Space Complexity_: O(sum length of each N + N) - +N to save string version of each input number.

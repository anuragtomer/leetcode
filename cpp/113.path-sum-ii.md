# Path Sum II

_Problem Statement_
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

_Solution_:
- Idea is to simply do a in-order traversal while maintaining the path in a vector and how much targetSum is left.
- If we reach a leaf, we check if target sum == root->val. If so, we append the current path to result vector otherwise bail out.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n)** - n being the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node only once.
_Space Complexity_: O(klogn) - At any point, we maintain only nodes in a single path. If there are k solutions, then we would need to maintain all of them.

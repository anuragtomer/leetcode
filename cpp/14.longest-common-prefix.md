#Longest Common Prefix

_Problem Statement_:
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

_Solution_:
A simple one.
- Pick the first character of first string. Check if the character is there at same position in rest of the strings as well.
- If it is, pick the next and try again.
- If not, return current set of matched characters.

_Space Complexity_: **O(n)**: If each string is of same size, and have same characters, then O(n). We are not saving anything extra.
_Time Complexity_: **O(n.m)**: We need to traverse all characters of all the strings.

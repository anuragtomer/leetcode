#Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

_Problem Statement_:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

_Solution_:
- Maintain 2 stacks. 1 for current level which you would be traversing. 1 for next level which is basically children.
- Keep a boolean to denote are you traversing tree from _left to right_ or _right to left_.
- Always pop from front/top (basic stack property). If you're traversing from left to right, push left child first to stack, otherwise push right child.
- This is because let's say you're traversing from left to right and you pushed right child first (and left child second). Then when traversing next level, ideally you should be printing right to left, but since you pushed right first left second, you would pop left child first and then right child. Which would make no sense.

_Time Complexity_: **O(n)** - We would be traversing each node only once. So both worst case and best case is O(n), n being the number of nodes.
_Space Complexity_: O(2 * max(width of the tree)), O(N) again. Stack would maintain nodes from single level, and there would be 2 such stacks.

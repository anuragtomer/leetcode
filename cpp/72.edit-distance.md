# Edit Distance

_Problem Statement_:
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

_Solution Idea_:
- Dynamic Problem
- Maintain a 2-d vector denoting what is the minimum changes required to make 2 strings same.
- To update an entry at (i,j):
  - If the current charaters match, would be same as minimum number of changes required at previous indices (i-1, j-1).
  - If they don't match, it would be 1 + minimum of (If I delete current character from word1/insert a character in word2, if I insert a character in word1/delete a character from word2, if I replace a character in either), i.e., dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i][j];:w
- Return last entry of 2-d vector

_Time Complexity_: **O(n.m)** - Traverse both strings
_Space Complexity_: **O(n.m)** - 2-d Vector to save minimum operations till now. Can be reduced to O(n + m) since we only need last state and nothing before that.
